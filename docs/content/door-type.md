# Door type

Door is the name that the entrance and exit points of the route receive.

There are only 2 types of doors:
- **Front Door**
- **Back Door**

This is used to determine varios behaviors, like the distance to front/back doors to leave the route when crawling or if the *Back Door* can be used to enter the route again (in backwards direction)
