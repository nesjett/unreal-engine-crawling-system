# Movement direction

This Enum is used to determine the current movement direction. It is used by the *Animation Blueprint* to run it on the right direction.

The possible values are:
- **Forward**: When the character is moving (or willing to move) forwards
- **Backward**: When the character is moving (or willing to move) backwards
- **None**: When the Character is not moving at all
