# Creating routes

The system provides an easy to use Route Actor that already implements the basic functionalities.

It can be either used directly in the game world to create routes "on the fly" or can be extended (create child classes) to add some more logic or shapes/meshes.

In this page we will be boarding both ways of using It.
